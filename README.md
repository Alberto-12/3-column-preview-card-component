## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to work with Flexbox.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 327px;
  height: 1326px;
  background-color: var(--Bright-orange);
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to improve on working with Flexbox.

### Useful resources
